Lists
-----
The Lists page displays all the lists available to the current user. A List is a user-curated list of objects of the same type.

From the Lists page you can see the number of entities contained in each List, the object type in the List, who created the List, when it was last updated, and a toggle to make the List private or public.

From the drop-down menu on each row you can rename, change the privacy settings, or delete a list.

On the Lists page you can sort the Lists by Name, Object Type, Author, Updated Date, and Privacy.

Clicking on a List will take you to the detail page, where you can view the objects contained in that list.

You can also:

- :ref:`HideOrShowAttributes`
- :ref:`MergeEntities`
- :ref:`DownloadACSVOfEntities`
- :ref:`AddToList`
