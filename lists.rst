Lists
-----
The Lists page displays lists available to the current user. A List is a user-curated list of entities of the same type.

Clicking on the Lists tab in the navigation menu will display the lists available to the current user.

From the List view you can see the number of entities contained in the List, the object type in the List, who created the List, when it was last updated, and a toggle to make the List private or public.
