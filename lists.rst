The Lists page displays lists available to the current user. A List is a user-curated list of entities of the same type.

Clicking on the Lists tab in the navigation menu will display the lists available to the current user.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: rename a list, make public of private a list, or delete a list.

On the Lists page you can click on a List to access it, sort the Lists by Name, Type, Author, Updated Date, and Privacy.

Clicking on a List will open a view of the entities contained in that list.

From the List view you can see the number of entities contained in the List, the entity type in the List, who created the List, when it was last updated, and a toggle to make the List private or public.
