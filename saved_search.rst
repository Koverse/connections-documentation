Saved Searches
--------------
A saved search allows a user to use the search page to create a search with one or more search criteria or filters and save it so that they may use it again or share it with others.

Unlike Lists which contain static data from a pervious search, saved searches are dynamic. For example:

1. You perform a search and create a saved search
2. New data is loaded into your Koverse Connections environment after you created a saved search
3. You access the previously created saved search
4. Any new data that was loaded will now appear in your saved search if it matches your criteria.

To create a saved search, first navigate to the Search page and apply one or more search criteria or filters to an entity type that you are searching within.

Click on the "SAVE SEARCH" button.

Once you have created a saved search, you can access the saved search on the "SAVED SEARCHES PAGE".

You can sort saved searches based on: Name, Type, Author, Created Date, Updated Date, and Privacy. To sort, simply click on the column header you want to sort by.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: Rename a saved search, make Public or Private a saved search, or Delete a saved search.

By clicking on a saved search, you will be taken to the search page where you can continue to modify the search criteria and filters. This will not affect the saved search.

Once modified, clicking "SAVE SEARCH" and naming the search will create a new saved search.

Lists
-----
The Lists page displays lists available to the current user. A List is a user-curated list of entities of the same type.

Clicking on the Lists tab in the navigation menu will display the lists available to the current user.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: rename a list, make public of private a list, or delete a list.

On the Lists page you can click on a List to access it, sort the Lists by Name, Type, Author, Updated Date, and Privacy.

Clicking on a List will open a view of the entities contained in that list.

From the List view you can see the number of entities contained in the List, the entity type in the List, who created the List, when it was last updated, and a toggle to make the List private or public.
