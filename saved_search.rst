Saved Searches
--------------
A saved search allows a user to use the search page to create a search with one or more search criteria or filters and save it so that they may use it again or share it with others.

Unlike Lists which contain static data from a pervious search, saved searches are dynamic. For example:

1. You perform a search and create a saved search
2. New data is loaded into your Koverse Connections environment after you created a saved search
3. You access the previously created saved search
4. Any new data that was loaded will now appear in your saved search if it matches your criteria.

To create a saved search, first navigate to the Search page and apply one or more search criteria or filters to an object type that you are searching within.

Click on the "SAVE SEARCH" button.

Once you have created a saved search, you can access the saved search on the "Saved Searches" page.

You can sort saved searches based on: Name, Type, Author, Created Date, Updated Date, and Privacy. To sort, simply click on the column header you want to sort by.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: Rename a saved search, make Public or Private a saved search, or Delete a saved search.

By clicking on a saved search, you will be taken to the search page where you can continue to modify the search criteria and filters. This will not affect the saved search.

Once modified, clicking "SAVE SEARCH" and naming the search will create a new saved search.
