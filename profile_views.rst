2. Edit Categories
  - Choose the entity type your profile view will display
  - Create categories of properties
    - When creating categories, properties contained in a category will be grouped and displayed together in the profile view.

In the Profile Views tab you can drag-and-drop profile views for an entity to change their priority. This will determine which profile view is seen first when you open the details of an entity, as well as the order of profile view tabs on the entity details page.

From the Profiles View tab you can also edit, copy, or delete a profile view by clicking on the "ACTIONS" menu on each profile view.
