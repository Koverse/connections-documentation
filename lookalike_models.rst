Lookalike Models
----------------
A lookalike model takes a list as input and creates a new list that has recommendations for entities similar to those on the input list.

Create a Lookalike Model
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create a lookalike model navigate to the Lookalike Models tab and click "CREATE LOOKALIKE MODEL":

1. Name Your Lookalike Model
  - Koverse Connections stores all lookalike models in specific Lookalike Models list, so there is no   need to name it 'Weighted model of ...' Instead, try to give it a self explanatory and meaningful to you name.
2. Select one list from the table below
  - The list you select is the list your lookalike model will be based upon.
3. Click "CREATE MODEL"

Your lookalike model will now appear in the Lookalike Models tab.
