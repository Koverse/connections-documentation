Search
------
The search page allows you to search and filter across all the objects in the system.

Clicking on an object type will limit the search results to objects of that type.

Enter some text into the search field and press return to apply the text entered as a filter.

The select boxes in the "Filter By" section are populated with values that are found in the various fields for the chosen object type. Selecting a value will apply it as a filter.

To remove a filter, simply click the "X" next to the property.

You can also click on "CLEAR FILTERS" to remove all currently applied filters.

Clicking on an object in the search results will display an expanded view of that object with its associated view tabs. Each view is customizable by an admin.

You can also:

- :ref:`HideOrShowAttributes`
- :ref:`MergeEntities`
- :ref:`DownloadACSVOfEntities`
- :ref:`AddToList`
