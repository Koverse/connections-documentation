In the Views tab you can drag-and-drop views for an object to change their priority. This will determine which view is seen first when you open the details of an object, as well as the order of view tabs on the object details page.

From the Views tab you can also edit, copy, or delete a view by clicking on the "ACTIONS" menu on each view.
