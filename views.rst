Views present the properties of an object. All object types have a default view and may have multiple views. Views can be created and customized by admins.

To create a new view, from the Views page click on "CREATE VIEW". You will be asked to:

1. Name the View

2. Choose the Object Type the view will apply to

3. Select Fields
  - Drag and drop the available fields to the tier you want them to display.
  - When creating tiers, fields contained in a tier will be grouped and displayed together in the view.
  - You can rearrange fields via drag-and-drop within tiers to change their order. The field listed first will be displayed first within the tier.
  - You can rearrange tiers via drag-and-drop to change the order in which they appear in the view.
  - Clicking on the context menu ••• for a tier allows you to "Rename" or "Delete" a tier.

4. Preview View
  - Here you can see the ordering of tiers and fields within tiers for an example object. If you do not like the way tiers or fields are ordered you can go back to the "Select Fields" step.

In the Views tab you can drag-and-drop views for an object to change their priority. This will determine which view is seen first when you open the details of an object, as well as the order of view tabs on the object details page.

From the Views tab you can also edit, copy, or delete a view by clicking on the "ACTIONS" menu on each view.
