- `Create a List`_
- `Add to a List`_
- `Download a CSV of Entities`_
- `Merge Entities`_
- `Hide or Show Attributes`_

Saved Searches
--------------
A saved search allows a user to use the search page to create a search with one or more search criteria or filters and save it so that they may use it again or share it with others.

Unlike Lists which contain static data from a pervious search, saved searches are dynamic. For example:

1. You perform a search and create a saved search
2. New data is loaded into your Koverse Connections environment after you created a saved search
3. You access the previously created saved search
4. Any new data that was loaded will now appear in your saved search if it matches your criteria.

To create a saved search, first navigate to the Search page and apply one or more search criteria or filters to an object type that you are searching within.

Click on the "SAVE SEARCH" button.

.. image:: ../kc-docs/create_saved_search.png

Once you have created a saved search, you can access the saved search on the "SAVED SEARCHES PAGE".

You can sort saved searches based on: Name, Type, Author, Created Date, Updated Date, and Privacy. To sort, simply click on the column header you want to sort by.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: Rename a saved search, make Public or Private a saved search, or Delete a saved search.

.. image:: ../kc-docs/saved_search_actions.png

By clicking on a saved search, you will be taken to the search page where you can continue to modify the search criteria and filters. This will not affect the saved search.

Once modified, clicking "SAVE SEARCH" and naming the search will create a new saved search.

Lists
-----
The Lists page displays lists available to the current user. A List is a user-curated list of entities of the same type.

Clicking on the Lists tab in the navigation menu will display the lists available to the current user.

From the Actions drop-down menu you can: rename a list, make public of private a list, or delete a list.

.. image:: ../kc-docs/list_actions.png

On the Lists page you can click on a List to access it, sort the Lists by Name, Type, Author, Updated Date, and Privacy.

Clicking on a List will open a view of the entities contained in that list.

From the List view you can see the number of entities contained in the List, the object type in the List, who created the List, when it was last updated, and a toggle to make the List private or public.

- Rename the lookalike model
- See the object results of the lookalike model

Scoring Models
---------------
A Scoring Model creates a list based on user selected value scoring. For example: Potential customers are scored based on an algorithm that is as follows:
0.2*assets+0.3*last quarter performance+0.25*consultant rating+0.25*percent assets in S&P 500.

Create a Scoring Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++
To create a scoring model navigate to the Scoring Models tab and click "CREATE WEIGHTED MODEL". You will be asked to:

1. Name Your Scoring Model
  - Koverse Connections stores all scoring models in specific Scoring Models list, so there is no need to name it 'Scoring model of ...' Instead, try to give it a self explanatory and meaningful to you name.
2. Choose the object type your scoring model will run on
3. Choose the fields and values you would like to focus on for your new scoring model
  - If a field has more than one value, you may select one or multiple values. On the next page you will be able to individually score each value. (NEEDS IMAGE)

Clicking on a flag will open details about that flag including:

- The field that was flagged
- The status of the flag (pending, approved, dismissed)
- Reason for the flag
- Old value for the field

Review Flags
============

- Click on the Flags tab
  - You will be brought to a page of flags filtered by Pending, sorted by Date
- Click on the pending flag you want to review
- Follow one of the below workflows depending on the decision to dismiss or approve a flag

4. Approve a flag with a new empty value (old value and user value are removed)
  - In the new value dialogue box, delete the user suggested value (the dialogue box should now be empty).
    - This removes the old value as well as the value the user suggested when initially flagged, but replaces it with no value, instead of a newly created admin value.
  - Click on "APPROVE FLAG"
  - The flag will now appear under "Filter By Approved"

Views
-----
Views present the properties of an object. All object types have a default view and may have multiple views. Views can be created and customized.

To create a new view, from the Views tab click on "CREATE VIEW". You will be asked to:

1. Edit Name
  - Name your view
2. Edit Categories
  - Choose the object type your view will display
  - Create categories of properties
    - When creating categories, properties contained in a category will be grouped and displayed together in the view.

    .. image:: ../kc-docs/create_and_order_cat_properties.png

    - You can rearrange properties via drag-and-drop within categories to change their order. The property listed first will be displayed first within the category.
    - You can rearrange categories via drag-and-drop to change the order in which they appear in the view.
    - Clicking on the context menu ••• for a category allows you to "Rename" or "Delete" a category.

    .. image:: ../kc-docs/category_options.png
      :height: 250

3. Preview View
  - Here you can see the ordering of categories and properties within categories. If you do not like the way categories or properties are ordered you can go back to the "Edit Categories"

  .. image:: ../kc-docs/category_ordering_example.png

In the Views tab you can drag-and-drop views for an object to change their priority. This will determine which view is seen first when you open the details of an object, as well as the order of view tabs on the object details page.

From the Views tab you can also edit, copy, or delete a view by clicking on the "ACTIONS" menu on each view.

Users
-----
From the Users tab, you will see the User Management page. Here you can change an account to a user (if the account is currently an admin) or change an account to an admin (if the account is currently a user), disable or enable an account, and change the password for an account.

.. image:: ../kc-docs/user_administration.png

Groups
------
Groups can be used to give a number of users specific permissions.

To create a group, click on the Groups tab and click "CREATE GROUP". You will be asked to give the group a name and description.

Each group can only be assigned permissions for one  on one object.

Assigning groups permissions is useful in cases such as sales territoties. For example, a company may have a state field that is used to set up regions:

- West Coast sales group gets permissions for entities with State values WA, OR, or CA
- Rocky Mountains sales group gets permissions for entities with State values ID, MT, WY, CO, AZ, or NM
- A Wesetern Sales VP would be added as a user to both sales groups to be able to view all western states.

Create a Group
++++++++++++++
To create a group, from the Groups tab, click on "CREATE GROUP".

You will be asked to:

1. Name your group
2. Give your group a description

.. image:: ../kc-docs/create_group.png
    :height: 250
    :width: 250

Groups Options
++++++++++++++
From the Groups tab you can click on a group to access more details.

From the actions menu drop down you can: edit a group, copy a group, or delete a group.

.. image:: ../kc-docs/group_actions.png

On the details page of a group you can:

- View more information about the group including: Name, who created the group edit the group, group members, the permissions given to the group (if they already exist)
- Edit the group: name, and description
- Delete the group
- Add or Remove members from the group
- Add permissions (if no permissions exist)
- Edit or Delete permissions (if permissions exist)

Groups Additional information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once a value is assigned to a permission of a group, any values not assigned will not be visible to any other user. This means for all values to be visible, you must assign them to permissions of one or more groups. If you only need a subset of values to be visible, then you only need to assign those values to the groups you create.

If permissions have been assigned to a value, any users not part of the group or groups with permissions for those values will not be able to see any entities that include those values.

To ensure that users can view all entities they should have access to, appropriate users should be added to all appropriate groups that have permissions associated with values of the entities the users should have access to. For example, the Sales Territory groups:

- West Coast sales group gets permissions for entities with State values WA, OR, or CA
- Any user outside sales that needs to view entities with State values WA, OR, or CA, should be added to the West Coast sales group or another group that has permissions associated with values WA, OR, or CA.
